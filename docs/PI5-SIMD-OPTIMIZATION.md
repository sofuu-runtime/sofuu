# Pi 5 CPU Inference Optimization — NEON Tiles, Batched Glue, Profiling

Shipped 2026-10-14. Target device: Raspberry Pi 5 (4× Cortex-A76 @ 2.4 GHz,
NEON + DOTPROD only — no i8mm, no SVE). Scope: CPU prefill/decode throughput
for GGUF models below ~4B parameters.

## Results (234-token prompt, performance governor, same-session llama.cpp refs)

| Model                  | Before session | After (t/s prefill / decode) | llama.cpp (t/s)      |
|------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| Qwen3-0.6B Q4_K_M      | 52.2 / 19.9    | 110.4 / 22.0                 | 176.3 / 23.6         |
| Llama-3.2-1B Q8_0      | 27.5 / 8.4     | 120.5 / 8.7                  | 60.2 / 8.5           |
| Spark-X2.5-4B Q4_K_M   | 5.2 / 4.0      | 14.0 / 4.1                   | 22.8 / 4.2           |
| liquid-350 BF16        | 16.4 / 5.4     | 17.2 / 5.4                   | —                    |
| liquid-350 MLX4        | 6.7 / 6.4      | 6.7 / 6.6                    | —                    |

Highlights: Llama-1B Q8_0 prefill **2.0× faster than llama.cpp**; decode equal
or better on every model. Decode is memory-bandwidth-bound on both engines
(~8.6 GB/s effective) — that is the Pi 5 hardware ceiling.

## What changed

### 1. NEON 8×4 repack tile kernels (`src/simd/arch/a76_repack.h`)

Ported llama.cpp's DOTPROD-path repack kernels verbatim:

- `ggml_gemv/gemm_q4_K_8x4_q8_K`, `ggml_gemv/gemm_q6_K_8x4_q8_K`,
  `ggml_gemv/gemm_q8_0_4x4_q8_0` (8-row interleaved weight tiles, 4-row
  activation tiles, `vdotq_laneq_s32` inner loops),
- `ggml_quantize_mat_q8_0_4x4` (NEON activation quantizer),
- `decode_q_Kx8_6bit_scales` helper.

All six bodies are machine-diff verified byte-identical to the reference
(modulo `tile_block_*` struct renames). Weight tiles are repacked at model
load (`sofuu_tile_warm` / lazy `sofuu_tile_lookup`); every fallback path is
guarded — non-A76 hosts get the generic kernels unchanged. `SOFUU_NO_TILES=1`
disables the tile path entirely as a kill switch.

### 2. Dispatch + scratch lifetime (`src/simd/infer_kernels.cpp`)

- Batch GEMM entry points route to the NEON wrappers (batch ≥ 2, rows/cols
  aligned, tile lookup hit) with generic/SDOT fallbacks preserved.
- `tile_scratch<T>()`: reuse a `thread_local` scratch for activation tiles
  instead of allocating and zero-filling a fresh vector on every weight-matrix
  call (~280 KB per call at batch 64). Measured +16% on Qwen prefill.

### 3. Chunk scheduling (`crates/sofuu-core/src/infer/{model,spark}.rs`)

- `max_prefill_batch()` (default 64) replaces the build-time
  `MAX_PREFILL_BATCH` constant; overridable at process start with
  `SOFUU_PREFILL_BATCH`, snapped to a multiple of 4. 64 measured optimal
  (128/256 within noise or slower).
- The final prefill chunk is split into a 4-aligned main body (so the tiled
  GEMM path stays eligible for every token) plus a ≤3-row remainder that goes
  through the verified scalar/SDOT path. Worth +27% prefill on Spark, where a
  78-token prompt previously dropped its 14-token tail onto the slow path.

### 4. Batched elementwise glue (one FFI call per layer)

Previously norms, biases, RoPE, KV scatter, SwiGLU and residual adds ran as
~4,000 per-token FFI calls per 64-token chunk. New internal-parallel kernels
(`sofuu_batched_rmsnorm[_in_place]`, `sofuu_batched_mad`,
`sofuu_batched_add_bias`, `sofuu_batched_swiglu`, `sofuu_batched_rope_kv`)
replace each per-token loop with a single call driven by the thread pool.

### 5. Profiling (`SOFUU_PROFILE=1`)

Per-chunk wall-time split (gemm / gemv / attention / other) printed to stderr
via a zero-cost-when-disabled RAII profiler (`quant::prof`). Findings that
drove the work above: Qwen q4_K GEMM ≈ 76 GMAC/s (scale-FMA-bound — the same
wall llama.cpp's identical kernel sits at), q8_0 GEMM ≈ 166 GMAC/s, attention
internally parallel and ~12% of prefill, residual glue < 27% and dropping.

## Verification

- Host suite: 523/523 (`cargo test -p sofuu-core --release --lib`).
  Includes the renamed-fixture fix for `test_tile_gemv_q8_0_matches_reference`
  (the old test built the f16 scale bytes from f32 low-mantissa bits and
  compared against the net dot product; the fixture now uses f16-exact deltas
  and a cancellation-safe L1-relative tolerance).
- Device E2E: templated-prompt coherence, clean EOS stops, and full
  `pi_bench.sh` battery runs on every shipped binary; llama.cpp reference
  numbers measured on-device in the same session (`-t 4`).

## Known gaps / next levers

- q4_K prefill GEMM is scale-FMA-bound in both engines. Pre-decoding the
  6-bit scales into float sidecars at repack time would remove the scale
  decode + bias-correction chain from the hot loop (est. 1.3–1.5× on q4_K).
- Spark per-matmul shapes run at roughly half the q4_K rate of Qwen's shapes;
  needs a shape/alignment audit of its fused-QKV row-range matmats.
- Decode is at the DRAM wall for both engines; further decode gains require
  reading fewer bytes per token, not faster kernels.
